    <h2>What is CSS?</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets</li>
        <br>
        <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen,paper or in the media. </li>
        <br>
        <li><span id="abc1">Css is not necessary</span><span id="abc2">CSS saves a lot of work.</span>it can control the layout of multiple webpages all at once.</li>
        <br>
        <li><span id="abc3">External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</span></li>
    </ol>
    <h3>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h3>
    <ul class="def1">
        <li >Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements</li>
        <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
        <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files.However,<span id="ghi">in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles</span>.because this is easier to demonstrate,and easier for youto try it yourself.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When comparing CSS class vs ID,the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements.ID,on the other hand,applies a style to one unique element.ID is also special in that you can use a special URl.to link directly to an element and it's used by Javascript.</p>
    <p>In CSS,selector are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page.Once an element has been targeted,a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.</p>
    <p>There is a wide range of selectors available.Two of the most commonly used are class and ID.Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
